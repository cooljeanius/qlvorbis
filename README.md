qlvorbis
========

A QuickLook plugin for ogg vorbis files.

***NOTE:***

There are several broken/non-existent parts at present:

- seeking doesn't work yet, consequentially, there are no playback controls in the QuickLook dialog
- the QuickLook dialog doesn't have much (any) useful information about the file
- when activating QuickLook via spacebar in finder, the file will continue to play for a period of time after the QuickLook dialog is dismissed
- the code only supports constant bit rate (CBR) files at present so attempting to QuickLook a variable bit rate (VBR) file with this plugin may make your computer unhappy
- The things you know, the things you don't know, the things you don't know you don't know â€¦ 

### Build Instructions
In order to build this project, you will need to do the following:

1. Download and build the libogg and libvorbis frameworks from [xiph.org](http://xiph.org/downloads/)
	- I used libogg v1.3.1 and libvorbis v1.3.3 for testing
	- The qlvorbis project is set up to use dynamic libraries by default so make sure the Xcode **Install Path** build setting is set to **@rpath** for both frameworks.
	- If using Xcode v4.x+ you will have to make some additional changes to the project build settings for each framework in order for them to build.
2. Download and open the **qlvorbis** Xcode project
	- add the libogg.framework and libvorbis.framework files to the project
	- add both frameworks to the **Copy files to Frameworks** build phase.
3. Copy the resulting **qlvorbis.qlgenerator** file to **~/Library/QuickLook**
	- The qlvorbis project has a build phase to do this for you.

***NOTE:*** When running the .qlgenerator form within Xcode, LLDB occasionally reports that the **the bundle qlvorbis couldn't be loaded**. The debugger error is vague and the system console doesn't report anything meaningful (to me). As a result, I don't have a good answer for the cause, but the problem seems to go away if the libogg and libvorbis frameworks are removed from the project, rebuilt, and then re-added. I see this behavior when using both the release and debug versions of the frameworks.
